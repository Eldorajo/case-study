` We’re also doing much more around cash management and automating the flows into your various accounts. We’ve already launched our two-way sweep, which through cash analysis of your checking account, figures out how much cash you need to cover 21 to 35 days’ worth of expenses. It always maintains that much in your checking account by looking at your bills and paychecks—in a real-time way—and then sweeps all the rest into savings. If you have a big bill come up or need extra cash, it automatically sweeps money back into your checking account. That kind of smart automation—putting things on autopilot and just letting you be—is the future of all financial services. `
